<h1>Wardriving</h1>
<div>As a side project I decided to try out 'Wardriving'. You might be familiar with the term from the old 80's movie 'WarGames', and the concept is really not much different. 'Wardriving' is a recon technique, where a cybersecurity professional conducts search on vulnerable WiFi hotspots while in motion.

Nowadays, you can do wardriving with only one device - your Android phone.</div>
