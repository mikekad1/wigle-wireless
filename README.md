<h1>Wardriving</h1>
<div>As a side project I decided to try out 'Wardriving'. You might be familiar with the term from the old 80's movie 'WarGames', and the concept is really not much different. 'Wardriving' is a recon technique, where a cybersecurity professional conducts search on vulnerable WiFi hotspots while in motion. In old times, this involved having to drive with a specific equipment and GPS while marking down all the questionable locations. Nowadays, you can do wardriving with only one device - your Android phone.</div>
<div>So where do we begin? Let's find out...</div>

- First thing I would suggest is, to use an old, completely refurbished phone that you normally don't use. This way you will preserve your anonimity and separate your work and your personal life.
- We are going to avoid signing into the Google Play by getting NetHunter app store and downloading the app from it.
- Now that we have our Wardriving device, head on to https://wigle.net/ and create your account. This is where you will be able to see your stats and logs as well as a map (you won't be able to use map on the phone unless you pay for subscription).
- Great. Now that we have an account, fire up your WiGLE app and sign in using the same credentials. This will ensure that your data will get uploaded.

- Of course, you need access to the internet in order to connect to your account and to upload, so make sure you have a travel sim of some sort inserted to provide you with wifi network connection.
- Make sure you don't keep your app running without uploading for the long time. There is a window of how many logs you can upload and if you exceed that limit, you will be stuck without ability to clear the buffer. In this case you are going to have to re-install the app.
- Head back to the website on your computer to review. You can see your progress in the 'Stats' section. You might even get a badge to show off your Wardriving skills ).
- Finally, if you head to the 'View' -> 'Map'. You can filter the results to show your progress and locations that you covered:

Looks exciting doesn't it? And all with just a simple Android app). Happy Wardriving!
